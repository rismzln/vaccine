      <div class="parallax"></div>

<div style="height:500px;color: black;background-color::#f4f4f4;font-size:24px; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">
  An unvaccinated boy almost died after falling seriously ill with the first case of tetanus in one US state for more than 30 years.

  The six-year-old spent two months in hospital with the bacterial illness after suffering a deep cut while playing in a farm in Oregon, according to a case study published by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

  His care cost nearly $1m (£770,000), about 72 times the average for a paediatric hospitalisation in the US, noted the paper, in a case that has alarmed preventative medicine experts.

  The unidentified child received an emergency dose of the tetanus vaccine in the hospital, but his parents declined to give him a second dose – or any other childhood immunisation injections – after he recovered.

  "When I read that, my jaw dropped. I could not believe it,” said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Tennessee. “That's a tragedy and a misunderstanding, and I'm just flabbergasted.”
