      <p style="font-size:24px">Measles outbreaks in many parts of the world are spooking public health authorities and highlighting the dangers of the anti-vaccination movement. The World Health Organization (WHO) listed vaccine hesitancy as a top threat in 2019, and several countries are taking action to tighten immunization laws.</p>
      <h2 style="font-size:26px">Outbreaks Around the World</h2>
      <p style="font-size:24px">The number of measles cases around the globe has jumped 30 percent [PDF] since 2016, with resurgences extending from parts of North America to Southeast Asia. Most vulnerable to the highly contagious disease are young children, as well as adults with weakened immune systems, such as HIV/AIDS patients. Measles typically causes rash and fever, and in extreme cases it can lead to blindness, brain swelling, or even death.</p>

Americas. Eight U.S. states have suffered major outbreaks in recent years, including New York, with more than 275 cases in 2019, and Washington, with more than seventy. In crisis-stricken Venezuela, an outbreak has neighboring countries scrambling to contain the disease.</p>

<p style="font-size:24px">Europe. Cases are at their highest level in twenty years, with France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom all reporting widespread outbreaks. Cases in Ukraine, where the vaccination rate has plummeted to one the lowest in the world, fueled a 2018 spike for the region.</p>

<p style="font-size:24px">Asia. A mass immunization campaign in Pakistan sought to end a 2018 outbreak, when the number of cases skyrocketed to over thirty thousand. In early 2019, health officials in the Philippines declared an outbreak in Manila spurred by panic about the safety of a dengue fever vaccine; by late February, the outbreak had spread to several other parts of the country and killed more than two hundred people.</p>

<p style="font-size:24px">Africa. Madagascar is in the midst of one of its worst measles outbreaks in decades, as weak health infrastructure and the vaccineâ€™s relatively high cost is putting vaccination out of reach for many.<p>
